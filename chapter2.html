	<h1> The Story in the Book </h1>
	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
	<p> Moly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of her <i>Nature</i>
		<i>New Scientist</i>, and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the
		road</cite>. It had been Moly's favourite book since college and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt 
		she needed to be free.
	</p>
	
	<p>She had spen the last 10 years in this room sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wild's quote proclaiming that 
		<q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
		the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Moly <em>did</em>
		think sha had something better to do.
